# Diet Recipe Chatbot and Streamlit Deployment üç≤ü•ó 

## Project Overview

üç≤ This project focuses on creating a diet recipe chatbot to assist users in finding suitable recipes based on their dietary preferences. 
The chatbot is implemented in a Colab notebook and deployed using Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface.

## 1. Data Preprocessing

The initial step involves preprocessing the dataset to clean and prepare it for use in the chatbot.

### Steps:
- Load the dataset and check for null values and duplicates.
- Apply preprocessing functions to standardize text and remove unwanted characters.

## 2. Diet Recipe Chatbot (Colab Notebook)

ü•ó A rule-based chatbot was created in a Colab notebook to interact with users and recommend recipes based on their diet preferences.

### Features:
- Users can input their diet type, course, cuisine, and preferred preparation time.
- The chatbot filters recipes based on user inputs and suggests suitable recipes.
- Users can choose a recipe to view its details, including ingredients and instructions.

## 3. Streamlit Deployment of Diet Recipe Chatbot

üçõ The same functionality of the Colab notebook chatbot was implemented and deployed using Streamlit to provide a web-based interface for user interaction.

### Features:
- Interactive web interface for user inputs.
- Dynamic filtering of recipes based on user preferences.
- Display of selected recipe details with a user-friendly layout.

### How to Run the Project

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Run the preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the dataset.
2. **Diet Recipe Chatbot**:
   - **Colab Notebook**: Use the Colab notebook to interact with the chatbot.
   - **Streamlit Deployment**: Run the Streamlit app for a web-based chatbot interface.


### Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive solution for diet recipe recommendations through a rule-based chatbot. The deployment of the chatbot using Streamlit makes it easily accessible and user-friendly.
